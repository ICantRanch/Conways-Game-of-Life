# Conways-Game-of-Life
Conways Game of Life in JavaFx with Timer as well as a Step-by-Step function

This program creates a board, either a random one with defined size or one from a file, and then procedes to 
update the simulation on a timer and follows the rules of the Game of Life, which determine which cells survive, die, or are born.

This program uses a file chooser so the user can use a preexisting pattern stored in a text file.
The file must be in the form of of 0's and 1's where a '1' represents a live cell and must be a 
rectangular prism, denoting a new row of cells with a new line.

An Example:  
000000  
000000  
001110  
011100  
000000  
000000
